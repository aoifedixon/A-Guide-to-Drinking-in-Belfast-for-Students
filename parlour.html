		<p>Deals on drinks include 2 for £5.75 on "Backyard Basics." The "7 Deadly Gins" is a new additon to the menu which is a choice of 7 gins at £3.45 for a single or £5.95 for double.</p>
		<h3>Beer Garden</h3>
		<p>Yes, we have a beer garden! Nestled at the back of The Parlour, the recently renovated Beer Garden holds over 150 people and is perfect for chilling out with mates or using as a great alternative spot for a private party.
